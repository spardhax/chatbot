# Mat the Matcha Bot

I'll be building a very basic chatbot from scratch using Python's NLTK library. Mat the Matcha bot will educate users about the benefits of consuming matcha green tea.

## Motivation
I recently abandoned coffee and completely switched to matcha green tea. While I really enjoy my verdant and delicious drink, I realised that there are multiple myths and misconceptions regarding matcha green tea. As I was researching, I was curious about matcha's health benefits, its caffeine concentration, preparation methods etc. I wanted to create a chatbot that would make it easier for people like me to get responses to their queries. 

## Blog
I wrote a blog post about chatbots, their working process and how I built Mat. The blog includes a brief summary of creating this basic chatbot and a detailed explanation as well. Check it out [here](https://spardha13.medium.com/building-a-basic-chatbot-with-pythons-nltk-library-8c0704fee9a2)!
